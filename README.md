## Overview
Butler is a platform independent framework for mobile robotics, deep learning and simulated algorithms for small UGVs and differential drive robots (such as [Kobuki](http://kobuki.yujinrobot.com/about2/) and [Jackal](https://clearpathrobotics.com/jackal-small-unmanned-ground-vehicle/)). The repository supports an array of algorithms aiming at mapping, localization, perception, and control in a variety of simulated environments.
